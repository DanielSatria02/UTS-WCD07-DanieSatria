//this is the intro using a simple console.log to create an output that cannot be interacted with by user
console.log("Hello, this is a calculator to calculate the area of a rectangle\n");
//setting variable with values except one because the variable area will hold the result
let width = 10, length = 20, area;
//displayng the values of width and length
console.log("Width is: ",width, "\n");
console.log("Length: ",length,"\n");
//calculating Area, multiplying symbol is *
area = width * length;
//placing the variable 'Area' after string message so it shows after it not before
console.log("The Area of this rectangle is: ", area);
